## Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing annotation between MS2 spectra acquired under various experimental conditions.
- 🌱 I’m diving into the world of AI, exploring how to seamlessly integrate it into my daily coding routine.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about R, processing MS2 spectra, or spectral databases—always happy to share insights!
- 📫 You can reach me via email for any queries or collaborations.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him/his
- 🌟 Fun fact: Everyone calls me Badi —it’s a diminutive of my last name, but in Spanish it sounds like “body”. Meeting new people often feels like a gym joke waiting to happen! 💪😂
